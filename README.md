ML-Magda-Burnout: 26-Day ML Learning Journey
Career transition project - Learning ML engineering through daily practice (Ljubljana, Slovenia)

📈 Results Summary
Day	Milestone	ROC-AUC	Status
25	Streamlit Dashboard	Production	✅ LIVE
26	CV 5-Fold + Features	1.000	✅ Complete

⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER (Real Talk)
This is a LEARNING project (26 days from zero) using synthetic tutorial dataset with perfect correlations:

ROC 1.000 CV = Dataset engineered for success (not production)

Real Kaggle datasets expected: ROC 0.80-0.90

✅ WHAT I LEARNED (Real Skills)
Production ML Pipeline:

✅ End-to-end sklearn Pipeline (preprocessing + VotingClassifier)

✅ Streamlit dashboard (localhost:8501) - sliders → predictions

✅ Cross-validation 5-fold (StratifiedKFold)

✅ Feature importance RF+XGB ensemble

✅ Debugging pipeline errors (OneHotEncoder names)

Business Insights:

WorkHoursPerWeek = 39.4% burnout prediction

SatisfactionLevel = 27.1%

StressLevel = 25.5%
